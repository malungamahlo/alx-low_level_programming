## Description

This repository includes a set of C programs that range from basic tasks like string manipulation to more advanced challenges such as parsing and generating passwords. Each program is self-contained and can be compiled and executed independently.

## List of Programs

1. **reset_to_98.c**: A program that demonstrates how to update the value of an integer using a pointer.

2. **swap_int.c**: A program that swaps the values of two integers using pointers.

3. **_strlen.c**: A program that calculates the length of a string.

4. **_puts.c**: A program that prints a string to the standard output.

5. **print_rev.c**: A program that prints a string in reverse order.

6. **rev_string.c**: A program that reverses a string.

7. **puts2.c**: A program that prints every other character of a string.

8. **puts_half.c**: A program that prints the second half of a string.

9. **print_array.c**: A program that prints a specified number of elements from an array of integers.

10. **_strcpy.c**: A program that copies a string from source to destination.

11. **_atoi.c**: A program that converts a string to an integer.

12. **101-keygen.c**: An advanced program that generates random valid passwords for a specific program.

## Usage

You can compile and run each program individually. Refer to the specific program's instructions in its corresponding directory for details on how to use it.

## Compilation

To compile a program, you can use a C compiler like GCC. Here's an example of how to compile a program named `program_name.c`:

```shell
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra program_name.c -o program_name
